----------------------------------------------
## This engine is coded by Yoshubs, a very contreversial person. If you dont wanna be looked at a little funny I would advise AGAINST this engine, otherwise enjoy.
----------------------------------------------
This is a fork of FE-Legacy, expect things to be buggy as its all still a WIP.
----------------------------------------------
# Features:
* Noteskins;
* Custom UIs;
* Options Menu with FPS Capping and Adjustments;
* A lot of modularity and freedom with options
* A restructure/partial remake of the base game's codebase;
* ``source/`` folder abstraction;
* More streamlined code
    * (only having to set things in one place).
